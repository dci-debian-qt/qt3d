qt3d-opensource-src (5.7.1~20161122+dfsg-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Lisandro Damián Nicanor Pérez Meyer ]
  * New upstream snapshot.
    - Bump Qt build dependencies.
  * Bump Standards-Version, no changes required.
  * Update packaging:
    - Libs with "Renderer" changed it's name to "Render". This changes
      SONAME but there are still no rdeps in the archive.
    - Documentation is now shipped under qt3d/.
    - libqt3d5collision5 is not shipped anymore.
    - Ship libqt3dquickinput5.
    - gltfsceneparser now has an auxiliary binary.
    - Regenerate symbols files for all libs. This makes handling both the
      SONAME change and the symbols's nodes changes easier. We still have no
      reverse dependencies to care for.
  * Use secure URLs for the repos.
  * Fix duplicated short description.
  * Update debian/copyright.
    - Do not ship examples/qt3d/planets-qml/images/*, they are clearly
      non-free.
  * Add extensions to xvfb-run needed by tests.
  * Run only one test at a time, this seems to make qaspectengine's
    setRootEntity work.
  * Rename qt3d-gltfsceneparser-plugin to qt3d-gltfsceneio-plugin and
    qt3d-assimpsceneparser-plugin to qt3d-assimpsceneio-plugin following
    upstream's changes.
  * Re do symbols files, this is the first API/ABI stable version that gets
    into Debian.
  * Do not build planets-qml example due to the lack of the required images,
    as we need to remove them from the tarball for being undistributable.

  [ Dmitry Shachnev ]
  * Exclude audio-visualizer-qml example from the tarball because it contains
    a non-free MP3 file (CC BY-ND 2.0).
    - Add qtmultimedia5-dev to Build-Conflicts to make sure that example is
      not built.
    - Tell uscan to repack the tarball.
  * Add some new symbols that appeared in 5.6.1.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.8, no changes needed.

    by qt3d's controls.
